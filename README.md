# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree project
# Exploratory data analysis with R

In this project, we perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the `./wineQualityReds.csv` dataset that contains chemical information of 1599 different red wines. The goal is to gain insight into the key properties that influence the quality of the product. 
To this end, we study the distribution and correlation of the different wine features.

### Contents

The EDA of this dataset was performed with R.
The code and the report of this project can be found in `./red_wine.Rmd` and `./red_wine.html` respectively.
